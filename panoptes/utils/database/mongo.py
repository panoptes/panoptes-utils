        This is a collection of parameters that are initialized when the unit
        starts and can be read and updated as the project is running. The server
        is a wrapper around a mongodb collection.

        Note:
            Because mongo can create collections at runtime, the pymongo module
            will also lazily create both databases and collections based off of
            attributes on the client. This means the attributes do not need to
            exist on the client object beforehand and attributes assigned to the
            object will automagically create a database and collection.

            Because of this, we manually store a list of valid collections that
            we want to access so that we do not get spuriously created collections
            or databases.

        Args:
            db_name (str, optional): Name of the database containing the collections.
            host (str, optional): hostname running MongoDB.
            port (int, optional): port running MongoDb.
            connect (bool, optional): Connect to mongo on create, defaults to True.

        Raises:
            ConnectionError: If the mongod server is not available.
