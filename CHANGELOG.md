## [0.2.5] - 2020-03-18

### Added

* Github Actions testing and coverage upload. (#145)
  * Log files for testing are created as an artifact.
* `PanLogger` helper class added. Mostly handles formatting but can also track handlers. (#145)

### Bug fixes

* Fixed top-level namespace so we can have other `panoptes` repos. (#150, fixes #137)

### Changed

* Data files for testing are copied before tests. Allows for reuse of unsolved fits file. (#144)
* Fix astrometry data file directories in Docker images. (#144)

## [0.2.3] - 2020-03-08

Small point release to correct namespace and remove some bloat.

### Changed

* Fixed top-level namespace so we can have other `panoptes` repos. (#137)

### Removed

* Dependencies that will be deprecated soon and are causing bloat: `photutils`, `scikit-image`. (#138)

## [Unreleased]

### Changed

* Fixed top-level namespace so we can have other `panoptes` repos (#137, #150).

## [0.2.2] - 2020-03-05

Mostly some cleanup from the `v0.2.0` release based on integrating all the changes into POCS.

### Bug fixes

* Misc bugs introduced as part of last release, including to `download-data.py` script.
* Custom exceptions now properly pass `kwargs` through to parent (#135).

### Changed

* New script for downloading data, `scripts/download-data.py`. This helped resolve some issues with the relative imports introduced in `v0.2.0` and is cleaner. (#129)
* All dependencies are smashed into one "feature" in `setup.py` to make `pip-tools` work well. This will fix the docker image problems introduced in `v0.2.1`. (#136)

### Removed

* The `get_root_logger` and associated tests (#134).

## [0.2.0] - 2020-03-04

First big overhaul of the repository. Pulls in features that were duplicated or scattered across [POCS](https://github.com/panoptes/POCS.git) and [PIAA](https://github.com/panoptes/PIAA.git). Removes a lot of code that wasn't being used or was otherwise clutter. Overhauls the logging system to use [`loguru`](https://github.com/Delgan/loguru) so things are simplified. Updates to documentation.

### Added
* Config Server
  * See the description in the [README](README.md#id11)
* [Versioneer](https://github.com/warner/python-versioneer) for version strings (#123).
* Read the docs config (#123).

### Bug fixes
* IERS Mirror (#65, #67)

### Changed
* Docker updates
  * See #68 and #75 for list.
* Logging:
  * Switch to [`loguru`](https://github.com/Delgan/loguru). This simplifies our logging system. Also gives us access to the `trace` (lower than `debug`, good for hardware and other debug we don't need to see during operation) and `success` (higher than `info`) levels, which would be nice to start implementing. (#123)
* Consistent use of relative imports. (#123)
* Documentation updates. (#97, #119, #120, #123)
* Repo cleanup. (#97, #123)
* Using GitHub Actions for testing. (#100, #101)
* Using [`pip-tools`](https://github.com/jazzband/pip-tools) for dependency management.

## [0.1.0] - 2020-03-04

### Added
