Changelog
=========

0.2.34
------

Breaking
^^^^^^^^

* This release removes the Docker components from the repository, pushing some of the dependencies to ``POCS``. This is an attempt to make this module slimmer and more useful. 
* The ``astrometry.net`` plate solving tests have been removed since we no longer build and test against a Docker image. The plate solving will continue to transition to the self-contained ``plate-solver`` repository.


0.2.33
------

Added
^^^^^

* New ``panoptes.utils.serial.device.SerialDevice`` that will replace the ``rs232.SerialData``. New class uses the threaded reader with optional callback for better asynchronous reading from a serial device. Example notebook included. #274
* ``ObservationPathInfo`` allows for easy parsing of the standard PANOPTES file name scheme, as provided by ``PATH_MATCHER``. #282
* ``extract_metadata`` pulls FITS headers into a common dictionary structure. #282
* Docker updates: Add ``PYTHONUNBUFFERED`` to docker files; Remove ``version`` and ``deploy`` keys from docker compose files. #284

Changed
^^^^^^^

* The serial protocol handlers were moved to the ``panoptes.utils.serial.handlers`` namespace. #274
* Testing Dockerfile has ``privileged`` permission to get device ``loop``. #275
* Dockerfile: update ``conda`` in Dockerfile before installing environment; install ``panoptes-utils`` module in user-editable mode. #277
* Dockerfile: use ``condaforge/miniforge3`` as the base, which reduces image size. Push multi-stage builds for better caching. #278, #279
* Consistent multi-stage names in Dockerfile; added ``jupyter_console``. #280
* Change behavior of ``parse_config_directories`` so the ``base`` entry must always exist or be missing (in which case the cwd is used). Remove the ``must_exist`` param. #283


Fixed
^^^^^

* Don't nest storage objects for the ``PanFileDB``. #280

0.2.32 - 2020-03-19
-------------------

Added
^^^^^

* ``panoptes.utils.rs232.find_serial_port()`` can be used to look up a serial port from the vendor and product hex ids.  #269

Changed
^^^^^^^

* ``panoptes.utils.config.config.client.get_config()`` changed so ``default`` is the second parameter and function made less noisy overall. #272
* Updated to ``Pillow>=8.1.1`` for dependabot alert.  #273.

Removed
^^^^^^^

* ``panoptes.utils.logging`` which is just replaced by ``from loguru import logger``. # 272

0.2.32 - 2020-02-28
-------------------

Added
^^^^^

* Added an ``RGB`` IntEnum for easy iterating and consistent array access of rgb data. #265
* Added ``save_rgb_bg_fits`` that will save a FITS files with seven extensions: combined rgb map, and then the background and rms maps for each color. #265

Changed
^^^^^^^

* ``get_rgb_background`` only accepts a ``data`` argument and a filename can no longer be passed. #265
* Updated defaults for ``get_rgb_background``. #265
* ``get_stamp_slice`` has ``as_slices`` param added with default ``True`` for legacy behavior. If ``False`` then just the four points are returned. #265
* Test coverage will skip `noqa` markers and pytest will run all tests.  #265
* Added `ruamel.yaml` to base dependencies instead of just ``config`` extras. #265

Fixed
^^^^^

* The `timeout` parameter is now passed from `get_solve_field` to `solve_field`. #266


0.2.31 - 2020-01-31
-------------------

Added
^^^^^

* Docker musical chairs:

        under certain conditions when an uncompressed file of the same name was present alongside
        the compressed version. (#175)
    * Properly pass ``args`` and ``kwargs`` to ``astropy.io.fits.getdata``. (#180)

Changed
^^^^^^^

* Docker
    * Changed developer tag from ``dev`` to ``develop``. (#174)

    * Better checking for solved file at end (via ``is_celestial``).
    * Cleanup the cleanup of solve files, removing ``remove_extras`` option.

    * PanLogger class moved to POCS. (#186)

0.2.10 - 2020-04-13
-------------------

Added
^^^^^

* ``get_stars_from_footpr  int`` can accept a ``WCS`` directly instead of just the output from ``calc_footprint()``. (#164)
* Ability to create different tags for the docker image. The ``develop`` directory is now used to create a ``develop`` image and is provided along with ``latest``. (#165)
* ``get_rgb_backgrounds(return_separate-True)`` will now return the ``Background2D`` objects. (#166)
* Added BigQuery pandas dependencies. (#168)
* Added a developer image at ``panoptes-utils:dev``, which is also auto-built along with the ``latest`` in the cloudbuild. Offers a ``jupyter-lab`` instance along with a number of plotting modules. Can be easily started via ``panoptes-dev``. (#170, #171)

Bug fixes
^^^^^^^^^

* ``image_id_from_path`` and ``sequence_id_from_path`` can recognize a zero in the ``camera_id`` and ``None`` when no match. (#163)

* Do WCS match for all unmatched sources, not just matched sources. (#172)

Changed
^^^^^^^

* Docker entrypoint no longer tries to activate service account if ``$GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS`` is found. The python client libraries will recognize the env var so this means we can avoid installing ``gcloud`` utilities just to activate. (#165)
* The ``sources`` module does not require a BigQuery client to be passed but can start it's own. A warning is given if ``$GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS`` is not found. (#167)
* ``lookup_point_sources`` updates: default vmag range expanded so less false positive matches [4,18). (#168)
* Removed TOC from changelog. (#170)
* Sextractor param changes: (#171)
  * Threshold for detection changed from 3 pixels to 10 pixels.
  * Seeing changed from 0.7 arcsec to 15.3 arcsec. (Isn't used.)
  * Removed ``class_star`` from sextractor results.

Changed
^^^^^^^

* New script for downloading data, ``scripts/download-data.py``. This helped resolve some issues with the relative imports introduced in ``v0.2.0`` and is cleaner. (#129)
* All dependencies are smashed into one "feature" in ``setup.py`` to make ``pip-tools`` work well. This will fix the docker image problems introduced in ``v0.2.1``. (#136)

Removed
^^^^^^^

* The ``get_root_logger`` and associated tests (#134).

0.2.0 - 2020-03-04
------------------

First big overhaul of the repository. Pulls in features that were duplicated or scattered across `POCS <https://github.com/panoptes/POCS.git>`_ and `PIAA <https://github.com/panoptes/PIAA.git>`_. Removes a lot of code that wasn't being used or was otherwise clutter. Overhauls the logging system to use [``loguru``](https://github.com/Delgan/loguru) so things are simplified. Updates to documentation.

Added
^^^^^
* Config Server
* See the description in the [README](README.md)
* `Versioneer <https://github.com/warner/python-versioneer>`_ for version strings (#123).
* Read the docs config (#123).

Bug fixes
^^^^^^^^^
* IERS Mirror (#65, #67)

Changed
^^^^^^^
* Docker updates
* See #68 and #75 for list.
* Logging:
* Switch to `loguru <https://github.com/Delgan/loguru>`_. This simplifies our logging system. Also gives us access to the ``trace`` (lower than ``debug``, good for hardware and other debug we don't need to see during operation) and ``success`` (higher than ``info``) levels, which would be nice to start implementing. (#123)
* Consistent use of relative imports. (#123)
* Documentation updates. (#97, #119, #120, #123)
* Repo cleanup. (#97, #123)
* Using GitHub Actions for testing. (#100, #101)
* Using `pip-tools <https://github.com/jazzband/pip-tools>`_ for dependency management.
