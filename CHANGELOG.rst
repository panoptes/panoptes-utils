0.2.27dev
---------

Added
^^^^^

* Config server startup controlled via envvars, incorporating ``python-dotenv`` (@wtgee #241):

  * ``PANOPTES_CONFIG_HOST`` and ``PANOPTES_CONFIG_PORT``
  * ``PANOPTES_CONFIG_FILE``

Changed
^^^^^^^

* Config server updates (@wtgee #241):

  * Config server with project dir mounted can be started via ``docker/docker-testing.yaml``.
  * Config server flask instances are run on ``gevent`` wsgi server instead of development server.
  * ``host`` and ``port`` are specified at the top-level command, e.g. ``panoptes-config-server --host foobar --port 9999 get``.
  * ``host`` and ``port`` respect the above envvars above.
  * Options changed from ``auto-save`` and ``ignore-local`` to ``save-local`` and ``load-local``.
  * ``run`` command adds the``config_server.running=True`` entry to the server.
  * ``stop`` command added that sets ``config_server.running=False`` to break loop.


* Testing  (@wtgee #241): 

  * All testing is started from ``scripts/test-software.sh``.
  * The ``panoptes-config-server`` is started as an external service, not in the pytest conf.
  * Added a ``tests/env`` file that is used by the docker compose file for setting vars inside the running containers.
  * Config server uses ``tests/testing.yaml`` for all testing.
  * Testing logs are stored in ``./logs``, relative to the project root outside the container.
  * Coverage file is stored in ``/var/panoptes/logs``.
  * A ``scripts/wait-for-it.sh`` script added to check that config server is running properly before starting tests.


Fixed
^^^^^

* ``scripts/setup-local-environment.sh`` properly uses new base image if requested. (@wtgee #241)
* Docker images: fixed the created ``ssh`` directory for ``$PANUSER``. (@wtgee #240)

    * ``fpack``/``funpack`` and ``get_solve_field`` were not properly overwriting FITS files
        under certain conditions when an uncompressed file of the same name was present alongside
        the compressed version. (#175)
    * Properly pass ``args`` and ``kwargs`` to ``astropy.io.fits.getdata``. (#180)

Changed
^^^^^^^

* Docker
    * Changed developer tag from ``dev`` to ``develop``. (#174)
* FITS Utils changes (#173):
    * Uncompressed file is always used for solve because we were occasionally seeing odd errors as described in dstndstn/astrometry.net#182. (#173)

    * Better checking for solved file at end (via ``is_celestial``).
    * Cleanup the cleanup of solve files, removing ``remove_extras`` option.

    * PanLogger class moved to POCS. (#186)

0.2.10 - 2020-04-13
-------------------

Added
^^^^^

* ``get_stars_from_footpr  int`` can accept a ``WCS`` directly instead of just the output from ``calc_footprint()``. (#164)
* Ability to create different tags for the docker image. The ``develop`` directory is now used to create a ``develop`` image and is provided along with ``latest``. (#165)
* ``get_rgb_backgrounds(return_separate-True)`` will now return the ``Background2D`` objects. (#166)
* Added BigQuery pandas dependencies. (#168)
* Added a developer image at ``panoptes-utils:dev``, which is also auto-built along with the ``latest`` in the cloudbuild. Offers a ``jupyter-lab`` instance along with a number of plotting modules. Can be easily started via ``panoptes-dev``. (#170, #171)

Bug fixes
^^^^^^^^^

* ``image_id_from_path`` and ``sequence_id_from_path`` can recognize a zero in the ``camera_id`` and ``None`` when no match. (#163)

* Do WCS match for all unmatched sources, not just matched sources. (#172)

Changed
^^^^^^^

* The ``sources`` module does not require a BigQuery client to be passed but can start it's own. A warning is given if ``$GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS`` is not found. (#167)
* ``lookup_point_sources`` updates: default vmag range expanded so less false positive matches [4,18). (#168)
* Removed TOC from changelog. (#170)
* Sextractor param changes: (#171)
  * Threshold for detection changed from 3 pixels to 10 pixels.
  * Seeing changed from 0.7 arcsec to 15.3 arcsec. (Isn't used.)
  * Removed ``class_star`` from sextractor results.

0.2.2 - 2020-03-05
------------------

Mostly some cleanup from the ``v0.2.0`` release based on integrating all the changes into POCS.

Bug fixes
^^^^^^^^^

* Misc bugs introduced as part of last release, including to ``download-data.py`` script.
* Custom exceptions now properly pass ``kwargs`` through to parent (#135).

Changed
^^^^^^^

* New script for downloading data, ``scripts/download-data.py``. This helped resolve some issues with the relative imports introduced in ``v0.2.0`` and is cleaner. (#129)
* All dependencies are smashed into one "feature" in ``setup.py`` to make ``pip-tools`` work well. This will fix the docker image problems introduced in ``v0.2.1``. (#136)

Removed
^^^^^^^

* The ``get_root_logger`` and associated tests (#134).

0.2.0 - 2020-03-04
------------------

First big overhaul of the repository. Pulls in features that were duplicated or scattered across `POCS <https://github.com/panoptes/POCS.git>`_ and `PIAA <https://github.com/panoptes/PIAA.git>`_. Removes a lot of code that wasn't being used or was otherwise clutter. Overhauls the logging system to use [``loguru``](https://github.com/Delgan/loguru) so things are simplified. Updates to documentation.

Added
^^^^^
* Config Server
* See the description in the [README](README.md)
* `Versioneer <https://github.com/warner/python-versioneer>`_ for version strings (#123).

Changed
^^^^^^^
* Docker updates
* See #68 and #75 for list.
* Logging:
* Switch to `loguru <https://github.com/Delgan/loguru>`_. This simplifies our logging system. Also gives us access to the ``trace`` (lower than ``debug``, good for hardware and other debug we don't need to see during operation) and ``success`` (higher than ``info``) levels, which would be nice to start implementing. (#123)
* Consistent use of relative imports. (#123)
* Documentation updates. (#97, #119, #120, #123)
* Repo cleanup. (#97, #123)
* Using GitHub Actions for testing. (#100, #101)
* Using `pip-tools <https://github.com/jazzband/pip-tools>`_ for dependency management.
